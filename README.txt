# Clap and wash your hands for 20 seconds

## Description
Everyone has a 20s ditty to sing to while you wash your hands, 
here's another way visually to help you countdown the 20s when
washing your hands.

* Clap your hands (loudly), or tap it to start -- less painful :-)
* Flash a few times before the countdown starts
* It will count 10 seconds (clockwise), and 10 seconds (anti-clockwise).
* Flash to all LEDs turning green (leds all on) after the countdown has finished.

## Requires:

* A Circuit Playground Express
* CircuitPython.
